# Submarine-Robofest

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of an innovative submarine robot for the **Submarine Category** of Gujarat Robofest 4.0. The robot leverages principles of buoyancy and advanced control mechanisms to achieve underwater navigation and functionality.

## Features
- **Two Ballast Tank Systems**:
  - **Syringe/Plunger System**: Traditional method using high-torque motors and syringes for water intake and expulsion.
  - **Peristaltic Pump/Solenoid Valve System**: Vented tanks for precise water and air control.
- **Directional Control**: Water pumps as jet thrusters and tail fins powered by servo motors.
- **Propulsion**: Brushless DC motor-driven propellers.
- **Applications**: Underwater photography, marine research, exploration, and investigations.

## Components
### Structural
- Acrylic pipes and sheets
- PVC fittings, threaded rods, and 3D-printed components
- Rubber seals, epoxy resin, and CT1 sealant

### Electronics
- LiPo Battery (14.8V, 5000mAh)
- Motors: Brushless DC (750kv/630kv/320kv), High-Torque N20
- Peristaltic pump, solenoid valve, and water pumps
- Flysky RC Transmitter & Receiver
- LED light strips for illumination

## Key Specifications
- **Length**: ~125 cm  
- **Width/Height**: 14 cm  
- **Weight**: Optimized for buoyancy

## Methodology
1. Design internal and external housing using CAD models.
2. Implement ballast tank systems for vertical motion.
3. Assemble propulsion and control systems.
4. Ensure structural integrity and waterproofing.
5. Conduct thorough testing and integration.
